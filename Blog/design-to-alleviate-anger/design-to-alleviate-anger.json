Use this design as a reminder to prioritize your mental health and take breaks when necessary.\n- **Use Photography:** Look through your old photos or take new ones to create a positive visual reminder of happy memories. Incorporating photography into your design work can help bring a sense of nostalgia and joy.\n- **Make a Gratitude List:** Use graphic design to create a list of things you are grateful for. Adding visual elements like illustrated icons or handwritten fonts can make the list more personal and meaningful.\n- **Create a Mood Board:** A mood board is a collage of images and design elements that represent a certain emotion or theme.
