This will help the person giving the gift to know exactly what you want.\n3. **Be realistic:** It\u2019s important to be realistic when making your wish list. Don\u2019t ask for something that is impossible to get or that is too expensive.\n4. **Include a mix of things:** Your wish list should include a mix of things, from practical items that you need to fun and unique items that you want.\n5. **Share your list:** Once you have your list ready, share it with the people who will be giving you gifts.
