# Design Tricks to Conquer Disgust 🤢
### Disgust is a powerful emotion that can prevent us from reaching our full potential. Whether it’s disgust towards ourselves, others, or a particular situation, it can hold us back from achieving our goals and living our best lives. But did you know that Design can be used as a tool to overcome disgust? In this article, we’ll explore 10 tips for using Design to conquer disgust and unlock your true potential.

- **Identify the source of disgust:** The first step in overcoming disgust is to identify its source. Is it self-disgust? Disgust towards others? A specific situation? Understanding the source of your disgust will help you to better target your design solutions.
- **Use color to evoke positive emotions:** Color plays a powerful role in evoking emotions, and can be used to counteract disgust. Bright, warm colors like red and orange can help to boost confidence and self-esteem, while cool colors like blue and green can help to calm and soothe.
- **Play with texture:** Texture can also be used to evoke emotions and counteract disgust. Using textures like fur, velvet, and even slime can help to soften and neutralize disgust.
- **Use imagery that challenges disgust:** Rather than avoiding imagery that evokes disgust, consider using it in your design. By confronting and challenging disgust head-on, you can begin to desensitize yourself to it and overcome it.
- **Use humor:** Humor can be a powerful tool for overcoming disgust. Whether it’s a witty tagline or a cartoon character, incorporating humor into your design can help to defuse disgust and lighten the mood.
- **Use positive affirmations:** Positive affirmations are statements that can help to reprogram the mind and change negative thought patterns. Incorporating positive affirmations into your design can help to counteract disgust and boost self-esteem.
- **Incorporate symmetry:** Symmetry is a design principle that can help to create a sense of balance and stability. Incorporating symmetry into your design can help to counteract feelings of disgust and create a sense of order.
- **Use asymmetry:** Asymmetry can also be a powerful tool for overcoming disgust. By breaking the rules and creating unexpected and unique designs, asymmetry can help to break through disgust and create a sense of surprise and intrigue.
- **Create a sense of movement:** Movement can also be used to evoke emotions and counteract disgust. Incorporating movement into your design, whether it’s through animation or dynamic layouts, can help to create a sense of energy and vitality.

Design is a powerful tool that can be used to overcome disgust and unlock your true potential. By understanding the source of your disgust and using design principles like color, texture, imagery, humor, and typography, you can create designs that evoke positive emotions and counteract feelings of disgust. Try out these tips and see how Design can help you to conquer disgust and live your best life.
