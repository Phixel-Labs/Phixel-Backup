	<content>### Depression is a serious and often debilitating condition that can significantly impact your daily life. While it’s important to seek professional help, incorporating some graphic design techniques into your routine can also be a helpful tool in managing depression and improving your overall well-being. From journaling to creating a vision board, here are 10 ways that graphic design can help you overcome depression.

- **Journaling:** Use graphic design techniques like typography, layout, and color to create a visually appealing journal. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a therapeutic way to process and express your emotions.
- **Create a Vision Board:** Use graphic design software to create a visual representation of your goals and aspirations. Focusing on what you want to achieve can help redirect negative thoughts and give you a sense of purpose.
- **Use Photography:** Look through your old photos or take new ones to create a positive visual reminder of happy memories. Incorporating photography into your design work can help bring a sense of nostalgia and joy.
- **Practice Mindfulness:** Use design elements like symmetry and balance to create a sense of calm and bring awareness to your surroundings. Practicing mindfulness can help you focus on the present moment and let go of negative thoughts.
- Design for Self-Care: Create a self-care plan using graphic design elements like calming colors and uplifting quotes. Use this design as a reminder to prioritize your mental health and take breaks when necessary.
- **Get Creative:** Engaging in creative activities, such as graphic design, can help channel your negative emotions into something productive. Whether you’re drawing, painting, or designing on the computer, finding a creative outlet can provide a sense of accomplishment and release.
- **Make a Gratitude List:** Use graphic design to create a list of things you are grateful for. Adding visual elements like illustrated icons or handwritten fonts can make the list more personal and meaningful.
- **Create a Mood Board:** A mood board is a collage of images and design elements that represent a certain emotion or theme. Use graphic design to create a mood board that showcases calming and uplifting imagery to help improve your mood.
- **Use Positive Affirmations:** Use graphic design to create positive affirmations and display them in a prominent place as a daily reminder to stay positive and reframe negative thoughts.
- **Experiment with Color:** The use of color can have a big impact on our mood and the atmosphere of a space. By choosing calming shades like blue, green, and purple, you can create a relaxed and peaceful atmosphere. These colors are often associated with peace and serenity, making them a good choice for reducing stress and improving your mood.
