	<title>Collaborating with Phixel as a Freelance Professional 💰</title>
	<content>### Dear [user], 
## We hope you are doing well. Thank you for your interest in Phixel.
**We appreciate your time and effort in reaching out to us.**

In response to your inquiry, we would like to inform you that we are currently not hiring for a full-time [job] position. However, we are open to collaboration opportunities with freelance professionals on a project basis.

> We strive to connect with talents in Latin America and the US, but this is not a limiting factor for working together.

Our work model consists of agreeing on a fair value for the **completion of a specific part of a project**, as long as that value is compatible with the **budget established by the client**. If we reach an agreement, we will provide you with all the necessary materials and set realistic and adjusted deadlines before starting. We maintain open communication and make daily follow-ups if necessary to ensure that everything evolves correctly. The most important thing is for both of us to meet our responsibilities, so it is crucial that the **agreed dates are met**. Otherwise, we will have to cancel the work and look for other options.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could send us a portfolio of your previous work to get an idea of your skills and, if appropriate, explore the possibility of working together on a future project.

> This job is remote, meaning that you do not need to be in a specific physical location to collaborate with us.

**We hope we have been helpful and remain at your disposal for any other questions or inquiries.**

Sincerely, 
*The Phixel Team*</content>
