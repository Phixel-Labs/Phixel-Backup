			<h1>Collaborating with Phixel as a Freelance Professional 💰</h1>
			<h3>Dear [user], </h3>
<h2>We hope you are doing well. Thank you for your interest in Phixel.</h2>
<p><strong>We appreciate your time and effort in reaching out to us.</strong> </p>
<p>In response to your inquiry, we would like to inform you that we are currently not hiring for a full-time [job] position. However, we are open to collaboration opportunities with freelance professionals on a project basis. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We strive to connect with talents in Latin America and the US, but this is not a limiting factor for working together. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our work model consists of agreeing on a fair value for the <strong>completion of a specific part of a project</strong>, as long as that value is compatible with the <strong>budget established by the client</strong>. If we reach an agreement, we will provide you with all the necessary materials and set realistic and adjusted deadlines before starting. We maintain open communication and make daily follow-ups if necessary to ensure that everything evolves correctly. The most important thing is for both of us to meet our responsibilities, so it is crucial that the <strong>agreed dates are met</strong>. Otherwise, we will have to cancel the work and look for other options. </p>
<p>We would greatly appreciate it if you could send us a portfolio of your previous work to get an idea of your skills and, if appropriate, explore the possibility of working together on a future project. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This job is remote, meaning that you do not need to be in a specific physical location to collaborate with us. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We hope we have been helpful and remain at your disposal for any other questions or inquiries.</strong> </p>
<p>Sincerely, 
<em>The Phixel Team</em></p>
