Thank you for your interest in Phixel. \n**We appreciate your time and effort in reaching out to us.** \n\nIn response to your inquiry, we would like to inform you that we are currently not hiring for a full-time [job] position. However, we are open to collaboration opportunities with freelance professionals on a project basis. \n\n> We strive to connect with talents in Latin America and the US, but this is not a limiting factor for working together. \n\nOur work model consists of agreeing on a fair value for the **completion of a specific part of a project**, as long as that value is compatible with the **budget established by the client**. If we reach an agreement, we will provide you with all the necessary materials and set realistic and adjusted deadlines before starting. We maintain open communication and make daily follow-ups if necessary to ensure that everything evolves correctly. The most important thing is for both of us to meet our responsibilities, so it is crucial that the **agreed dates are met**. Otherwise, we will have to cancel the work and look for other options. \n\nWe would greatly appreciate it if you could send us a portfolio of your previous work to get an idea of your skills and, if appropriate, explore the possibility of working together on a future project. \n\n> This job is remote, meaning that you do not need to be in a specific physical location to collaborate with us. \n\n**We hope we have been helpful and remain at your disposal for any other questions or inquiries.** \n\nSincerely, \n*The Phixel Team*",
