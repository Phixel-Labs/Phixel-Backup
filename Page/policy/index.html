			<h1>Privacy Policy ⚖️</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This policy is intended to inform you how we at Phixel™, LLC, a Colombian limited liability company, (hereinafter “Phixel” or “we/us/our”) collect and use information provided by visitors to our website (located at phixel.net, hereinafter, our “Website”), by people who register at our Website, by students who enroll in our courses, by anyone who contracts for or purchases any of our products or services, and by individuals who communicate with our Website via e-mail or otherwise (collectively, “you/your”).</p>
<p>By visiting our Website, viewing its contents, registering on our Website, enrolling in our courses, purchasing our services or products and/or communicating with us via e-mail or otherwise, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Policy along with the terms of service set forth on our Terms &amp; Conditions page (located at <a href="https://phixel.net/terms">phixel.net/terms</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://phixel.net/terms">phixel.net/terms</a></p>
<p>If you do not wish to consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy or our Terms &amp; Conditions, please do not use or otherwise visit our Website, register on our Website, enroll in our courses, or purchase any of our products or services.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
<p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>
<p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>
<h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2>
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
<h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
<p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
<h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
<p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>

<h2>Deleting of Information</h2>
<p>You may ask us to delete some or all of the information you shared with us, provided, however, that we are not required to maintain that information as part of any commercial transaction or contract entered into between us. For example, we may need to maintain records of credit card transactions or products or services purchased by you from us for a period of time in the event any dispute or other occasion arises whereby that information may be required by third-parties or government entities.</p>
<p>You may request that we delete information provided by you to us by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@phixel.net">contact@phixel.net</a>.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:contact@phixel.net">contact@phixel.net</a></p>
<p>If you believe that we have inaccurate or incomplete information about you, you may request an update to your information by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@phixel.net">contact@phixel.net</a>.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:contact@phixel.net">contact@phixel.net</a></p>
<p>You may request that we limit the use of your information to only that information required for us to conduct any transactions in which you engage with us. For example, you may request that we discontinue sending e-mails or newsletters to you about upcoming courses or other information regarding our products and services. You may opt-out from these communications by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@phixel.net">contact@phixel.net</a> as well as following the instructions on the communications themselves.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:contact@phixel.net">contact@phixel.net</a></p>
<p>Unless you request that we delete information provided by you, we will maintain that information for a reasonable period of time in the event that you choose, in Phixel, to purchase our products or services. For example, you may complete one of our courses, and not find an additional course to be of interest to you at present; however, we may introduce a course in Phixel in which you may wish to enroll. By maintaining your information, we make the enrollment process easier, as well as allowing us to provide a history to you of courses in which you previously enrolled.</p>
<p>To maintain the integrity of our Website and the information you provide to us, we may copy that information to a secondary information storage device (AKA back-up). In the event that you request that we delete your information, we will also delete it from our back-up data storage to the extent that it is commercially reasonable to do so. Nevertheless, we do not access our back-up storage except under circumstances where data from our primary storage has been compromised (such as may occur during power surges or other situations where our primary storage may be damaged).</p>
