    "content": "## Overview\n\nThis policy is intended to inform you how we at Phixel\u2122, LLC, a Colombian limited liability company, (hereinafter \u201cPhixel\u201d or \u201cwe\/us\/our\u201d) collect and use information provided by visitors to our website (located at phixel.net, hereinafter, our \u201cWebsite\u201d), by people who register at our Website, by students who enroll in our courses, by anyone who contracts for or purchases any of our products or services, and by individuals who communicate with our Website via e-mail or otherwise (collectively, \u201cyou\/your\u201d).\n\nBy visiting our Website, viewing its contents, registering on our Website, enrolling in our courses, purchasing our services or products and\/or communicating with us via e-mail or otherwise, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Policy along with the terms of service set forth on our Terms & Conditions page (located at [phixel.net\/terms](https:\/\/phixel.net\/terms)).\n\n[phixel.net\/terms](https:\/\/phixel.net\/terms)\n\nIf you do not wish to consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy or our Terms & Conditions, please do not use or otherwise visit our Website, register on our Website, enroll in our courses, or purchase any of our products or services.\n\n## Comments\n\nWhen visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor\u2019s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.\n\nAn anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: [https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/](https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.\n\n[https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/](https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/)\n\n## Media\n\nIf you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.\n\n## Embedded content from other websites\n\nArticles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.\n\nThese websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.\n\n## How long we retain your data\n\nIf you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.\n\nFor users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.\n\n## What rights you have over your data\n\nIf you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.\n\n## Where your data is sent\n\nVisitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.\n\n## Collection of Information\n\nWe may collect and process your personal data in the following circumstances:\n\n- when you sign up \/ register for an account with us.\n- when you sign up for our newsletter (by entering your e-mail address).\n- when you order any products or services from us.\n- when you contact us via e-mail or otherwise.\n- when you provide us e-mail or other data in exchange for a free download.\n- when you enter any contests we may hold.\n- when you complete any surveys we may conduct.\n- when you visit our Website (via cookies or otherwise).\n\nNot all of the information we collect may be personally identifiable.

Such tracking software may change as technology improves.\n\nOur Website and the materials and services provided through our Website are not intended for children or those under the age of 16. If someone under the age of 16 wishes to use our Website, that individual is responsible for obtaining the consent from that individual\u2019s parents or legal guardians.\n\n## Use of Information\n\nWe use information that we gather from you in the following ways:\n\n- To provide services and materials through our Website.\n- To deliver information to you about the products, services and materials provided through our Website.\n- To fulfill our contractual obligations to you as part of any transaction or order involving our products, services and\/or materials.\n- To contact you about our products, services and Website.\n\nIn additional manners that we may describe to you when you provide information to us or when we notify you about new uses of information provided by you.\n\nBy visiting our website, providing us your e-mail address, signing up for our newsletter, registering for an account, ordering products or services from us or otherwise providing your personal information to us, as set forth above (under Collection of Information), you are consenting to receiving communications from us regarding our services and materials.\n\n## Sharing Information\n\nIf you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.\n\nWe will share information provided by you to third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

We do, however, track and record user sessions to improve the site experience for our users. We use various tracking software to do so including Google Analytics.

For example, we may need to maintain records of credit card transactions or products or services purchased by you from us for a period of time in the event any dispute or other occasion arises whereby that information may be required by third-parties or government entities.\n\nYou may request that we delete information provided by you to us by emailing [contact@phixel.net](mailto:contact@phixel.net).\n\n[contact@phixel.net](mailto:contact@phixel.net)\n\nIf you believe that we have inaccurate or incomplete information about you, you may request an update to your information by emailing [contact@phixel.net](mailto:contact@phixel.net).\n\n[contact@phixel.net](mailto:contact@phixel.net)\n\nYou may request that we limit the use of your information to only that information required for us to conduct any transactions in which you engage with us. For example, you may request that we discontinue sending e-mails or newsletters to you about upcoming courses or other information regarding our products and services. You may opt-out from these communications by emailing [contact@phixel.net](mailto:contact@phixel.net) as well as following the instructions on the communications themselves.\n\n[contact@phixel.net](mailto:contact@phixel.net)\n\nUnless you request that we delete information provided by you, we will maintain that information for a reasonable period of time in the event that you choose, in Phixel, to purchase our products or services. For example, you may complete one of our courses, and not find an additional course to be of interest to you at present; however, we may introduce a course in Phixel in which you may wish to enroll. By maintaining your information, we make the enrollment process easier, as well as allowing us to provide a history to you of courses in which you previously enrolled.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of our Website and the information you provide to us, we may copy that information to a secondary information storage device (AKA back-up). In the event that you request that we delete your information, we will also delete it from our back-up data storage to the extent that it is commercially reasonable to do so. Nevertheless, we do not access our back-up storage except under circumstances where data from our primary storage has been compromised (such as may occur during power surges or other situations where our primary storage may be damaged).\n\n## Cookies and Information\n\nIf you leave a comment on our site, you may opt-in to save your name, email address and website in cookies.
