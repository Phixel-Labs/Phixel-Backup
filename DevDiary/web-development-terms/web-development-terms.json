Every website on the internet has a unique address called a domain name. When you type a website's domain name into your web browser, the DNS is responsible for translating that name into an IP address that your computer can use to find the website.\n\n### API\nAn Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. When you type a website address into your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox), it uses HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with the website and load the web page on your device.\n\n### HTTP\nHTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). When you type a website address into your web browser, it uses HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with the website and load the web page on your device, is a set of rules that allows web browsers to communicate with websites and load web pages.
